In first always block, if state_in[0] then delayed_state <= {z0,...}. else state_out <= {z0,...}. In second always block, if state_in[0] then state_out <= delayed_state. So when state_in[0] is 1, first block writes delayed_state, second block writes state_out from delayed_state. But delayed_state is updated in same cycle, but non-blocking assignment ensures that delayed_state <= new value, but second block reads delayed_state from previous cycle? Actually both always blocks are triggered same time; the order of evaluation is not defined. But due to non-blocking, the new value of delayed_state will be visible to second block? In Verilog, non-blocking assignments update at end of time step, so second block will see old value. So state_out will get previous delayed_state, causing one cycle delay. That seems intended.

{"bug_id": 32, "raw": "analysisWe need to find a CWE vulnerability. The code is a key selection module for AES? It selects subkeys based on roundSel and decrypt flag. Potential vulnerabilities: improper access control to debug interface? But no debug interface. Maybe the key selection logic leaks key bits via timing or side channel? But we look for known CWE IDs in list: 1191, 1240, 1244, 1262, 1272, 1300, 203, 226, 276, 319, 325, 440, 441.\n\nWhich one applies? Let's examine code: The key selection uses combinational logic with conditional assignments based on decrypt_int. The decrypt_int is derived from roundSel[5:4] and decrypt. That seems fine.\n\nPotential issue: The key selection uses a case statement with 16 outputs K1..K16. But the assignments for each Kx are combinational assignments using K and decrypt_int. The K register is updated on clock edge with a case on {decrypt, roundSel[5:4]}. The assignments for K1..K16 are combinational and use K. But K is a reg updated on clock. The assignments for K1..K16 are continuous assignments, not sequential. So they are combinational logic that depends on K. That seems fine.\n\nBut vulnerability: The key selection logic may leak key bits through the output K_sub. But that's intended. However, maybe the issue is that the key selection logic is not protected against debug access: The module has no reset for K_sub? But K_sub is assigned combinationally. The key register K is reset to 0 on reset. But the key values are input key1, key2, key3. The module selects subkeys based on roundSel and decrypt. The vulnerability might be that the key selection logic is not protected against debug interface: The module may expose key bits via K_sub output. But that's expected.\n\nLook at the always @(clk) block: It uses non-blocking? It uses blocking assignment K = ...; but that's okay.\n\nPotential vulnerability: The module uses a case statement with 8 cases for decrypt and roundSel[5:4] but the default case is not covered? Actually case covers all 8 combos. Good.\n\nBut maybe the vulnerability is that the key selection logic uses a combinational assignment that may produce glitches or timing differences that leak key bits.

Not present.\n\nLook for sensitive data not cleared before reset: e.g., p_pt holds P-code, used as state for AES encryption. After encryption, p_pt may still hold data.

But the code uses AES to encrypt p_pt into l_code. But p_code is output as raw P-code. That might be sensitive. But is that a vulnerability? Possibly CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. The module outputs p_code and l_code. The p_code is not encrypted. So if p_code is sensitive, it's transmitted in cleartext.
